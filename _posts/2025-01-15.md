# My Journey from Math to Tech to Tarot

If you’d told me years ago that my career would span mathematics, software development, and tarot readings, I might have laughed—but life has a way of surprising us. Each step in my journey has taught me invaluable lessons about adaptability, growth, and the beauty of following unconventional paths.

## The Mathematical Foundations

My professional journey began with a love for mathematics. Pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley, I immersed myself in the world of cryptography, data structures, and algorithms. I loved how math provided elegant solutions to complex problems, and I thrived on the intellectual challenges it presented. My time at Berkeley taught me not only technical skills but also the resilience and curiosity needed to tackle unfamiliar concepts—a mindset that would serve me well in the years to come.

## Bridging Math and Technology

After graduating, I naturally gravitated toward the tech world, where my analytical background became a valuable asset. As a software developer, I worked on projects that ranged from building scalable web applications to creating automated testing frameworks. I loved the problem-solving aspect of development, where each line of code could bring an idea to life. My work taught me how to think systematically, communicate effectively with cross-functional teams, and embrace the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

One of the most fulfilling aspects of my tech career was mentoring junior developers. Watching others grow and succeed reminded me of the importance of collaboration and community in professional spaces.

## An Entrepreneurial Leap

My passion for creativity and connection eventually led me to take a bold step into entrepreneurship. In 2020, I launched **High Moon Apothecary**, a small business that blended my love for natural products with my desire to create meaningful experiences for others. Managing every aspect of the business—from designing product packaging to marketing and customer service—was both challenging and rewarding.

High Moon Apothecary wasn’t just a business; it was a community. Hosting events, engaging with customers, and seeing my creations bring joy to people’s lives gave me a deeper appreciation for the human side of work. It also sparked a new passion: blending logic and creativity to build something truly unique.

## A Spiritual Calling

As High Moon Apothecary thrived, I began to explore the spiritual side of life, reconnecting with my intuition and curiosity about the unseen. What started as a personal journey soon blossomed into a professional calling. I began offering tarot readings and facilitating spiritual gatherings, finding immense fulfillment in helping others navigate their own paths.

Being a tarot reader has been a transformative experience. It combines the logic and pattern recognition I honed in math and tech with the empathy and creativity I discovered as an entrepreneur. Each reading is a unique opportunity to connect deeply with someone, offering insights that empower and inspire them. The work reminds me that growth comes not just from solving external problems but also from understanding and nurturing our inner worlds.

## Lessons Learned Along the Way

Looking back, each chapter of my career has been a reflection of my core values: curiosity, adaptability, and a willingness to take risks. Mathematics taught me discipline and analytical thinking. Technology showed me the power of innovation and teamwork. Entrepreneurship awakened my creativity and strengthened my resilience. And tarot revealed the profound importance of human connection and intuition.

## Embracing the Journey Ahead

Today, I find myself in a unique position where all these experiences intertwine. Whether I’m developing software, mentoring others, facilitating a spiritual ceremony, or simply reflecting on life, I strive to approach each moment with authenticity and purpose. My journey from math to tech to tarot may not have been linear, but it has been deeply fulfilling—and I wouldn’t have it any other way.

If there’s one takeaway from my story, it’s this: follow your passions, even when they lead you down unexpected paths. You never know where curiosity might take you.
