Welcome! I’m Hazel, a dynamic and multifaceted professional based in San Diego, CA. With over a decade of diverse experience in software development, education, entrepreneurship, and creative fields, I’m passionate about blending technical expertise with artistic expression to drive impactful results.

As a seasoned software developer and IT specialist, I thrive on solving complex challenges and building user-focused solutions. Beyond tech, my journey includes small business ownership, community building, and personalized coaching, showcasing my ability to lead, adapt, and inspire in any setting.

When I’m not immersed in projects, you’ll find me exploring nature, facilitating spiritual gatherings, or creating art that celebrates transformation and individuality. Whether collaborating on a project or connecting over shared passions, I believe in fostering trust, growth, and authenticity in every interaction.

Let’s connect and create something extraordinary together!
